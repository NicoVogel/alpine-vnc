# Alpine-VNC

This is a simple and small alpine image which will be used as basis for other projects.


If you want to change the openbox menu, override the file */etc/xdg/openbox/menu.xml* in the image.

Also if you need another command and or entrypoint, the *supervisord* must be started. 
The command can be found at the end of the dockerfile.
